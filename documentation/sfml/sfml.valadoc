/** 
 * =Specialized shape representing a convex polygon=
 * 
 * This class inherits all the functions of sf.Transformable (position, rotation, scale, bounds, ...) as well as the functions of sf.Shape (outline, color, texture, ...).
 * 
 * It is important to keep in mind that a convex shape must always be... convex, otherwise it may not be drawn correctly. Moreover, the points must be defined in order; using a random order would result in an incorrect shape.
 * 
 * Usage example:
 * {{{
 * polygon = new ConvexShape();
 * polygon.setPointCount(3);
 * polygon.setPoint(0, sf.Vector2f(0, 0));
 * polygon.setPoint(1, sf.Vector2f(0, 10));

/** 
 * =Class for loading and manipulating character fonts.=
 * 
 * Fonts can be loaded from a file, from memory or from a custom stream, and supports the most common types of fonts.
 * 
 * See the loadFromFile function for the complete list of supported formats.
 * 
 * Once it is loaded, a sf.Font instance provides three types of information about the font:
 * 
 * Global metrics, such as the line spacing
 * Per-glyph metrics, such as bounding box or kerning
 * Pixel representation of glyphs
 * Fonts alone are not very useful: they hold the font data but cannot make anything useful of it. To do so you need to use the sf.Text class, which is able to properly output text with several options such as character size, style, color, position, rotation, etc. This separation allows more flexibility and better performances: indeed a sf.Font is a heavy resource, and any operation on it is slow (often too slow for real-time applications). On the other side, a sf.Text is a lightweight object which can combine the glyphs data and metrics of a sf.Font to display any text on a render target. Note that it is also possible to bind several sf.Text instances to the same sf.Font.
 * 
 * It is important to note that the sf.Text instance doesn't copy the font that it uses, it only keeps a reference to it. Thus, a sf.Font must not be destructed while it is used by a sf.Text (i.e. never write a function that uses a local sf.Font instance for creating a text).
 * 
 * Usage example:
 * {{{
 * // Declare a new font
 * var font = new Font.fromFile("arial.ttf");
 *  
 * if (font == null) {
 *     // error...
 * }
 *  
 * // Create a text which uses our font
 * var text1 = new Text();
 * text1.setFont(font);
 * text1.setCharacterSize(30);
 * text1.setStyle(sf.TextStyle.Regular);
 *  
 * // Create another text using the same font, but with different parameters
 * var text2 = new Text();
 * text2.setFont(font);
 * text2.setCharacterSize(50);
 * text2.setStyle(sf.TextStyle.Italic);
 * }}}
 * Apart from loading font files, and passing them to instances of sf.Text, you should normally not have to deal directly with this class. However, it may be useful to access the font metrics or rasterized glyphs for advanced usage.
 * 
 * Note that if the font is a bitmap font, it is not scalable, thus not all requested sizes will be available to use. This needs to be taken into consideration when using sf.Text. If you need to display text of a certain size, make sure the corresponding bitmap font that supports that size is used.

/** 
 * =Class for loading, manipulating and saving images.=
 * 
 * sf.Image is an abstraction to manipulate images as bidimensional arrays of pixels.
 * 
 * The class provides functions to load, read, write and save pixels, as well as many other useful functions.
 * 
 * sf.Image can handle a unique internal representation of pixels, which is RGBA 32 bits. This means that a pixel must be composed of 8 bits red, green, blue and alpha channels â€“ just like a sf.Color. All the functions that return an array of pixels follow this rule, and all parameters that you pass to sf.Image functions (such as loadFromMemory) must use this representation as well.
 * 
 * A sf.Image can be copied, but it is a heavy resource and if possible you should always use [const] references to pass or return them to avoid useless copies.
 * 
 * Usage example:
 * 
 * {{{
 * // Load an image file from a file
 * var background = new Image.FromFile("background.jpg");
 * if (background == null)
 *     return -1;
 *  
 * // Create a 20x20 image filled with black color
 * var image = new Image.fromColor(20, 20, sf.Color.Black);
 *  
 * // Copy image1 on image2 at position (10, 10)
 * image.copy(background, 10, 10);
 *  
 * // Make the top-left pixel transparent
 * var color = image.getPixel(0, 0);
 * color.a = 0;
 * image.setPixel(0, 0, color);

 * // Save the image to a file

/** 
 * =Give access to the real-time state of the sensors.=
 * 
 * sf.Sensor provides an interface to the state of the various sensors that a device provides.
 * 
 * It only contains static functions, so it's not meant to be instantiated.
 * 
 * This class allows users to query the sensors values at any time and directly, without having to deal with a window and its events. Compared to the SensorChanged event, sf.Sensor can retrieve the state of a sensor at any time (you don't need to store and update its current value on your side).
 * 
 * Depending on the OS and hardware of the device (phone, tablet, ...), some sensor types may not be available. You should always check the availability of a sensor before trying to read it, with the sf.Sensor.isAvailable function.
 * 
 * You may wonder why some sensor types look so similar, for example Accelerometer and Gravity / UserAcceleration. The first one is the raw measurement of the acceleration, and takes into account both the earth gravity and the user movement. The others are more precise: they provide these components separately, which is usually more useful. In fact they are not direct sensors, they are computed internally based on the raw acceleration and other sensors. This is exactly the same for Gyroscope vs Orientation.
 * 
 * Because sensors consume a non-negligible amount of current, they are all disabled by default. You must call sf.Sensor.setEnabled for each sensor in which you are interested.
 * 
 * Usage example:
 * {{{
 * if (sf.Sensor.isAvailable(sf.SensorType.Gravity))
 * {
 *     // gravity sensor is available
 * }
 *  
 * // enable the gravity sensor
 * sf.Sensor.setEnabled(sf.SensorType.Gravity, true);

/** 
 * =Give access to the real-time state of the joysticks.=
 * 
 * sf.Joystick provides an interface to the state of the joysticks.
 * 
 * It only contains static functions, so it's not meant to be instantiated. Instead, each joystick is identified by an index that is passed to the functions of this class.
 * 
 * This class allows users to query the state of joysticks at any time and directly, without having to deal with a window and its events. Compared to the JoystickMoved, JoystickButtonPressed and JoystickButtonReleased events, sf.Joystick can retrieve the state of axes and buttons of joysticks at any time (you don't need to store and update a boolean on your side in order to know if a button is pressed or released), and you always get the real state of joysticks, even if they are moved, pressed or released when your window is out of focus and no event is triggered.
 * 
 * SFML supports:
 * 
 * 8 joysticks (sf.Joystick.Count)
 * 32 buttons per joystick (sf.Joystick.ButtonCount)
 * 8 axes per joystick (sf.Joystick.AxisCount)
 * Unlike the keyboard or mouse, the state of joysticks is sometimes not directly available (depending on the OS), therefore an update() function must be called in order to update the current state of joysticks. When you have a window with event handling, this is done automatically, you don't need to call anything. But if you have no window, or if you want to check joysticks state before creating one, you must call sf.Joystick.update explicitly.
 * 
 * Usage example:
 * 
 * {{{
 * // Is joystick #0 connected?
 * bool connected = sf.Joystick.isConnected(0);
 *  
 * // How many buttons does joystick #0 support?
 * uint buttons = sf.Joystick.getButtonCount(0);
 *  
 * // Does joystick #0 define a X axis?

 * A sf.Window can create its own new window, or be embedded into an already existing control using the create(handle) function. This can be useful for embedding an OpenGL rendering area into a view which is part of a bigger GUI with existing windows, controls, etc. It can also serve as embedding an OpenGL rendering area into a window created by another (probably richer) GUI library like Qt or wxWidgets.
 * 
 * The sf.Window class provides a simple interface for manipulating the window: move, resize, show/hide, control mouse cursor, etc. It also provides event handling through its pollEvent() and waitEvent() functions.
 * 
 * Note that OpenGL experts can pass their own parameters (antialiasing level, bits for the depth and stencil buffers, etc.) to the OpenGL context attached to the window, with the sf.ContextSettings structure which is passed as an optional argument when creating the window.

 * 2D camera that defines what region is shown on screen
 * 
 * sf.View defines a camera in the 2D scene.
 * 
 * This is a very powerful concept: you can scroll, rotate or zoom the entire scene without altering the way that your drawable objects are drawn.
 * 
 * A view is composed of a source rectangle, which defines what part of the 2D scene is shown, and a target viewport, which defines where the contents of the source rectangle will be displayed on the render target (window or texture).
 * 
 * The viewport allows to map the scene to a custom part of the render target, and can be used for split-screen or for displaying a minimap, for example. If the source rectangle doesn't have the same size as the viewport, its contents will be stretched to fit in.
 * 
 * To apply a view, you have to assign it to the render target. Then, objects drawn in this render target will be affected by the view until you use another view.
 *
 * {{images/graphics-view-initial.png}}
 *

 * }}}
 * 
 * {{images/graphics-view-split-screen.png}}
